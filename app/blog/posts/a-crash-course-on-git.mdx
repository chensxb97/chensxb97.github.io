### What is Git?

*An open-source version control system for tracking modifications in source code and files.*

As a software developer, git has been part and parcel of my daily development workflow, allowing me to coordinate my code changes with other developers with ease, without worrying that one may overwrite or break the codebase.

Below are some basic terminology in git.

### Git Terms

HEAD              Reference to the most recent commit in the current branch

Pull request      An event created by a contributor to discuss and merge new code changes to the main branch.          
```

## Github != Git
	
*Git is a version control software tool that is used in the command line.*

*Github is a web hosting service for managing git repositories in the cloud.*

For most cases, users will use **git** to manage changes between repositories on their local machine and the remote ones in **Github**. **Github** is a web-hosting service that provides cloud-based storage and GUI for storing and managing the centralized repositories.

### Conclusion
The above list collates the many commands that I usually use in my day-to-day. This list is especially useful if you need remedies to common problematic scenarios (Eg. Accidentally pushing commits to master/dev branches: git reset; Trying to trace past commits for a specific file: git blame). Despite being around for almost 20 years, git still serves as a primary version control tool for many developers today. With most projects requiring multiple hands on deck and remote work being the new normal, it is hard for one to work on a project properly without it.
