In this post, I will be sharing why you should ditch the mouse and take the time to pick up and master keyboard shortcuts.

As a software engineer, *efficiency* is of the essence, especially when dealing with many mundane tasks and/or meeting tight deadlines. For any work setup, majority of the time is spent moving between the keyboard and mouse. 

Fortunately for us, this precious time can be saved by learning keyboard shortcuts that can perform the same functions.

Below is a compilation of shortcuts (Mac and Windows) that I will recommend for speeding up your workflows in web browsers, the Terminal and VSCode.

### Other ways to **shortcut** your workflow
1. Learn to [touch-type](https://www.typinglounge.com/typing-techniques), which incorporates all fingers to access your keyboard optimally. With sufficient practice, you will be able to save time by typing without glancing on the keys.

2. Use tabs for autocompletion in the Terminal, especially when your file paths are long/unknown.

3. When inputting text in multiple input boxes, use tabs instead of moving the mouse to proceed to the next input.

4. Use aliases to execute long/complex commands

    - alias `nrs=npm run start` (Executes `npm run start` with `nrs`)
    
    - alias `gps=git push` (Executes `git push` with `gps`)

5. Broadcast input to multiple Terminal tabs in the same session if the same executions need to be done on multiple replica servers - a nice feature of [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

### Conclusion
After being exposed to these shortcuts, I learnt how excruciatingly painful it is to have wasted time using the mouse or performing repetitive work.

For those who just received your laptop or are new to shortcuts, I recommend trying these out to boost your productivity!
