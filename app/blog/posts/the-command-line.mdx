### What is Command Line?

***A user interface where one can enter text prompts to execute commands or automate tasks.***

The terms: **Command Line, Bash, Shell, Terminal, Command Prompt**, are used interchangeably but they all generally mean the same thing. Below are some quick descriptions for each term.

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a user interface where users type in commands and view outputs printed on the screen.

- **Bash** is a shell and command language in Linux.

- **Shell** is a software that interprets and executes the various commands that we type in the CLI.

- **Terminal**, is a CLI application in Mac OS.

- **Command Prompt**, is a CLI application in Windows OS.

### Benefits of using the Command Line

While many users are accustomed to using a graphical user interface (GUI), the command line offers the following benefits:
- Direct interaction with the computer, with no overhead processing from the GUI, allowing faster and more efficient execution of tasks.

- Automation of commands and tasks by running scripts.

- Makes you feel like a hacker (sort of)

### What can we use it for?

In my day-to-day, I use the command line to:
- Inspect details of my localhost/servers/applications/processes

- Navigate and manipulate files and folders (Filesystem Management)

- Access servers over networks

- Run applications

- Debug logs

- Write and run scripts to automate tasks/applications

- Version Control (Git)

*Note: The above list is not exhaustive, use cases will differ between individuals*

###  Cheatsheet

The below cheatsheet is a compilation of commands that I either frequently used or found useful along the way when I approach the command line.

### Conclusion
The command line is the bread and butter application for all computer systems. Not only will it automate and speed up your day-to-day development work, it serves as a starting point for you to run, inspect and monitor the applications and filesystems of servers directly. For many who are initially starting out, this application looks and feels like a "black box". But rest assured, with sufficient exposure and practise, you will eventually master it and enjoy the many benefits this application brings to your everyday workflow.
