## What is Command Line?

<b>A user interface where one can enter text prompts to execute commands or automate tasks.</b>

The terms: <b>Command Line, Bash, Shell, Terminal, Command Prompt</b>, are used interchangeably but they all generally mean the same thing. Below are some quick descriptions for each term.

- <b>Command Line Interface (CLI)</b> is a user interface where users type in commands and view outputs printed on the screen.

- <b>Bash</b> is a shell and command language in Linux.

- <b>Shell</b> is a software that interprets and executes the various commands that we type in the CLI.

- <b>Terminal</b>, is a CLI application in Mac OS.

- <b>Command Prompt</b>, is a CLI application in Windows OS.

## Benefits of using the Command Line

While many users are accustomed to using a graphical user interface (GUI), the command line offers the following benefits:

- Direct interaction with the computer, with no overhead processing from the GUI, allowing faster and more efficient execution of tasks.
- Automation of commands and tasks by running scripts.
- Makes you feel like a hacker (sort of)

## What can we use it for?

In my day-to-day, I use the command line to:
- Inspect details of my localhost/servers/applications/processes
- Navigate and manipulate files and folders (Filesystem Management)
- Access servers over networks
- Run applications
- Debug logs
- Write and run scripts to automate tasks/applications
- Version Control (Git)

*Note: The above list is not exhaustive, use cases will differ between individuals*

##  Cheatsheet

The below cheatsheet is a compilation of commands that I either frequently used or found useful along the way when I approach the command line.

## Conclusion
The command line is the bread and butter application for all computer systems. Not only will it automate and speed up your day-to-day development work, it serves as a starting point for you to run, inspect and monitor the applications and filesystems of servers directly. For many who are initially starting out, this application looks and feels like a "black box". But rest assured, with sufficient exposure and practise, you will eventually master it and enjoy the many benefits this application brings to your everyday workflow.
