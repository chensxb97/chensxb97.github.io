*Please refer to this [post](/posts/Speed-Up-Using-Shortcuts-Windows) if you are a Windows user.*

In this post, I will be sharing why and how I ditched the mouse and started utilising keyboard shortcuts.

## Why avoid the mouse?
As a software engineer, *efficiency* is of the essence, especially when one is dealing with many tasks in his bucket or meeting tight deadlines. For any typing setup, majority of the time is spent moving between the keyboard and mouse. Fortunately for us, we can save this precious time by mastering keyboard shortcuts that can perform the same functions/tasks. Not only do you become more productive, you also get to look really cool (somewhat) and experience what it is like to feel like an experienced hacker (sortof).

It will require some practice to master and apply them properly. But rest assured, once you overcome this steep learning curve, you will witness your productivity drastically increase overtime. Below is a compilation of shortcuts that I have learnt and frequently use on Web browsers, Terminals and VSCode.

## Other ways to <b>shortcut</b> your workflow

1. Learn to [touch-type](https://www.typinglounge.com/typing-techniques), which incorporates all your fingers to access the keys on your keyboard optimally. With sufficient practice, you will be able to master typing without glancing on the keys, saving time as a result.
2. Use Tabs for autocompletion in the Terminal, especially when your folder/file names are long/foreign.
3. When inputing text in multiple input boxes, use Tabs instead of moving the mouse to proceed to the next input.
4. Use aliases to execute long/complex commands
<br/>Eg. alias `nrs`=`npm run start` (Executes `npm run start` with `nrs`)
<br/>Eg. alias `gps`=`git push` (Executes `git push` with `gps`)

5. Broadcast input to multiple Terminal tabs in the same session if the same executions need to be done on multiple replica servers (You will need to install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for this)

## Conclusion

Ever since I started learning and using these shortcuts, it was excruciating to realise the amount of time wasted performing repetitive work (Eg. Editing the same variable names repeatedly; Highlighting a block of text; Deleting characters one by one using Backspace).
To anyone who is using a computer, ditch the mouse and give these shortcuts a shot. Afterwards, you can reward yourself with a nice coffee break :)
